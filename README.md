# dull

`dull` provides a means of writing applications with windows that display a grid
of cells.
The windows bear a striking resemblance to terminal windows, but the similarity
is purely visual.

**warning :** dull is currently just an experiment, and is not ready for prime time.

## pre-requisites

* `go` - essential
* `make` - nice to have

## getting started

```bash
go get -v -u github.com/pekim/dull
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/pekim/dull

# install required go tools, and dull packages
make install

# run a simple demo
make run_simple
```
