Build the library
  ./configure --with-png=no --with-zlib=no --with-harfbuzz=no --with-pic
  make clean
  make install

Copy
  objs/.libs/libfreetype.a --> internal/font/freetype/libfreetype.a
  (recursively) include/ --> internal/font/freetype/include/

No dependencies
  The flags to configure ensure that the library is build with no dependencies.
  None of them are required for freetypes use in dull.

  With none of those dependencies there's no risk of trying to dynamically
  link to incompatible versions of them on any system at run time.

Position independent code should avoid issues with older linkers.
